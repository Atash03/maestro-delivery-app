## Notes & Decisions

### Testing Infrastructure
- Configured Jest with two projects: "unit" for .ts files and "components" for .tsx files
- Unit tests run in Node environment for faster execution
- Component tests use jest-expo preset for React Native compatibility
- Added test scripts: `bun run test`, `bun run test:watch`, `bun run test:coverage`
